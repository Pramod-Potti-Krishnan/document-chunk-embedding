Complete Database Session Fix Test Document
===========================================

This document tests the final fix for the document processing pipeline
after resolving both the TextChunker parameter issue and the database
session management in background tasks.

Expected Behavior:
1. Document uploads successfully
2. Progresses through text extraction (25%)
3. Progresses through chunking (50%)
4. Progresses through embedding generation (75%)
5. Successfully stores chunks in database (90%)
6. Completes processing (100%)

The complete fix includes:
- Using correct parameter names: chunk_size_max and chunk_overlap
- Providing fresh database sessions for background tasks
- Proper error handling and transaction management

This test content should create multiple chunks that can be
successfully stored in the database with their embeddings.
Each chunk will be indexed for vector similarity search.
