Final Database Session Fix Test
===============================

This document tests the complete fix for the background task database session issue.
After implementing the new session wrapper, documents should process successfully
through all stages:

1. Text extraction (25%)
2. Text chunking (50%)
3. Embedding generation (75%)
4. Database storage (90%)
5. Completion (100%)

The fix ensures that background tasks get their own fresh database session
instead of using the expired session from the main HTTP request.

This should resolve the issue where documents were getting stuck at 75%
with chunks failing to be stored in the database.
