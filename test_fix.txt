Database Session Fix Test Document
====================================

This document tests whether the database session fix resolves
the issue where documents get stuck at 75% because the background
task cannot store chunks due to a closed database session.

Expected Behavior:
1. Document uploads successfully
2. Progresses through text extraction (25%)
3. Progresses through chunking (50%)
4. Progresses through embedding generation (75%)
5. Successfully stores chunks in database (90%)
6. Completes processing (100%)

This test verifies that background tasks now get their own
fresh database session instead of using the expired session
from the main request.

Test Content Section:
The document processor should create multiple chunks from this content.
Each chunk should be stored in the database with its corresponding embedding.
The total_chunks field should reflect the actual number of chunks created.
