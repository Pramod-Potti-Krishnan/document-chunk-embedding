## 🔧 Railway Deployment Steps

### **1. Create Railway Project**
- [ ] Sign up/login to Railway
- [ ] Create new project from GitHub repo
- [ ] Select correct directory: `apps/document-processing-microservice/backend`

### **2. Set Environment Variables**
Copy from `.env.production.example` and set in Railway Dashboard:

**Required Variables:**
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` - Supabase connection string
- [ ] `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key
- [ ] `SECRET_KEY` - JWT secret key
- [ ] `SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- [ ] `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key

**Production Settings:**
- [ ] `ENVIRONMENT=production`
- [ ] `LOG_LEVEL=INFO`
- [ ] `LOG_FORMAT=json`
- [ ] `CORS_ORIGINS` - Your frontend domains

### **3. Deploy & Test**
- [ ] Click "Deploy" in Railway
- [ ] Wait for build completion (2-3 minutes)
- [ ] Get deployment URL
- [ ] Test health endpoint: `GET /api/health`

---

## 🧪 Post-Deployment Testing

### **Health Check Validation:**
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "environment": "production",
  "services": {
    "database": true,
    "embeddings": true,
    "vector_database": true,
    "filesystem": true,
    "memory_available": true,
    "disk_available": true
  }
}
```

### **API Functionality Tests:**
- [ ] **Document Upload**: `POST /api/documents/upload`
- [ ] **Status Tracking**: `GET /api/documents/status/{id}`
- [ ] **Document List**: `GET /api/documents/list`
- [ ] **Chunks Retrieval**: `GET /api/documents/{id}/chunks`
- [ ] **Document Deletion**: `DELETE /api/documents/{id}`

### **Monitoring Tests:**
- [ ] Check structured JSON logs in Railway dashboard
- [ ] Verify request IDs in response headers
- [ ] Test error handling with invalid requests
- [ ] Confirm CORS headers for frontend domains

---

## 📊 Performance Verification

### **Processing Pipeline Test:**
1. Upload a test document (PDF/DOCX)
2. Monitor processing status through completion
3. Verify chunks are stored in Supabase
4. Test vector similarity search

**Expected Timeline:**
- Upload acceptance: < 2 seconds
- Text extraction: 1-5 seconds
- Embedding generation: 2-10 seconds
- Total processing: 5-30 seconds

### **Load Testing:**
- [ ] Multiple concurrent uploads
- [ ] Rate limiting behavior (5000/hour)
- [ ] Memory usage under load
- [ ] Database connection pooling

---

## 🔒 Security Verification

### **Authentication & Authorization:**
- [ ] JWT token validation working
- [ ] Rate limiting active (5000 requests/hour)
- [ ] User isolation (can only access own documents)
- [ ] File type restrictions enforced

### **Infrastructure Security:**
- [ ] Non-root user in container
- [ ] Environment variables secure
- [ ] HTTPS endpoints only
- [ ] Input validation active

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Guide

### **Common Issues:**

**❌ Health Check Fails**
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Verify database connectivity
- Test OpenAI API key validity

**❌ Document Upload Fails**
- Check file size limits (50MB)
- Verify supported file types (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD)
- Test temp directory permissions

**❌ Processing Stuck**
- Monitor Railway logs for errors
- Check OpenAI API rate limits
- Verify database connection pool

### **Debug Commands:**
```bash
# Railway CLI commands
railway logs --tail          # View real-time logs
railway shell                # Access container shell
railway status               # Check deployment status
railway env                  # List environment variables
```

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

**Deployment is successful when:**
- [ ] Health endpoint returns "healthy" status
- [ ] Document upload completes end-to-end
- [ ] Chunks are stored in Supabase with embeddings
- [ ] API documentation accessible at `/api/docs`
- [ ] Structured logs visible in Railway dashboard
- [ ] Frontend can connect (CORS working)
- [ ] Rate limiting and auth functioning
- [ ] Error responses are properly formatted

---

## 📈 Monitoring & Maintenance

### **Ongoing Monitoring:**
- [ ] Set up Railway alerts for downtime
- [ ] Monitor API response times
- [ ] Track database storage growth
- [ ] Watch OpenAI API usage

### **Regular Health Checks:**
```bash
# Weekly verification
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/health

# Database status
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM document_chunks WHERE embedding IS NOT NULL;

# Recent activity
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM documents WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```
