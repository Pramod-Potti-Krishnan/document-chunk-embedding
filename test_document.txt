Document Processing Microservice Test Document
===============================================

This is a test document for the Document Processing Microservice.

Introduction
------------
The Document Processing Microservice is designed to handle document uploads,
process them into chunks, generate embeddings, and store them in a vector database
for semantic search capabilities.

Key Features
------------
1. Document Upload and Storage
   - Supports PDF, DOCX, TXT, and Markdown files
   - Secure file storage with hash verification
   - File size and type validation

2. Text Extraction
   - Automatic text extraction from various formats
   - Preserves document structure and metadata
   - Page-level tracking for multi-page documents

3. Text Chunking
   - Intelligent text chunking with overlap
   - Token counting for optimal chunk sizes
   - Maintains context across chunk boundaries

4. Embedding Generation
   - OpenAI text-embedding-3-small model
   - 1536-dimensional vectors
   - Batch processing for efficiency

5. Vector Storage
   - PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
   - Efficient similarity search
   - Hierarchical data organization

Testing the Service
-------------------
This document serves as a test case for the microservice.
It should be:
1. Successfully uploaded
2. Extracted and chunked
3. Embedded using OpenAI
4. Stored in the database
5. Retrievable via API

Conclusion
----------
The Document Processing Microservice provides a robust foundation
for document-based AI applications with semantic search capabilities.
