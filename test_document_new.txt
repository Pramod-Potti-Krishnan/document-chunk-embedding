Test Document for Fixed Processing
====================================

This is a test document to verify that the document processing pipeline
now works correctly after fixing the TextChunker parameter issue.

Key Features Tested:
1. Text extraction from TXT files
2. Text chunking with proper parameters
3. Embedding generation using OpenAI API
4. Storage in PostgreSQL with pgvector

Expected Result:
- Document should process beyond 50%
- Chunks should be created successfully
- Embeddings should be generated
- Final status should be "completed"

This document has enough content to create multiple chunks
and test the complete processing pipeline end-to-end.
The chunking system should work with the correct parameter
names: chunk_size_max and chunk_overlap instead of the
incorrect chunk_size parameter that was causing failures.
